# Mini Project 2 - School System

This repository contains a simple School System implemented in Java and Python. The project is organized into two folders: `java` and `python`, each containing a file for the respective script.

## Java Folder

### schoolsystem.java

This Java file (`schoolsystem.java`) represents the implementation of the School System in the Java programming language. The system allows users to manage students, teachers, and school records. The Java implementation includes classes for teachers, students, school records, and the school itself. The system provides features such as enrolling students, hiring teachers, updating student grades, filtering students, and viewing school records.

#### Usage

1. Run the program, and a menu will prompt you to choose an action.
2. Actions include enrolling a student, hiring a teacher, updating student grades, filtering students, viewing school records, and exiting the program.

#### Data Persistence

- The system saves and loads data from a file (`school_data.ser`) to maintain the state of students, teachers, and the school record between program runs.


## Python Folder

### schoolsystem.py

This Python file (`schoolsystem.py`) represents the implementation of the School System in the Python programming language. The Python implementation mirrors the functionality of the Java version, allowing users to manage students, teachers, and school records.

#### Usage

1. Run the program, and a menu will prompt you to choose an action.
2. Actions include enrolling a student, hiring a teacher, updating student grades, filtering students, viewing school records, and exiting the program.

#### Data Persistence

- The system saves and loads data from a file (`school_data.pkl`) to maintain the state of students, teachers, and the school record between program runs.


**Note:** This mini project is for my Intro to Programming Using Java & Intro to Programming Using Python class. Will probably be further extending or modifying to add more features and functionalities.
